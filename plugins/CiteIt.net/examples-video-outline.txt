How the CiteIt.net Code Works: A Tutorial for Developers


Purpose:
  * This video is intended for programmers who 
    want to learn more about the client code used in CiteIt.net.

Topics covered:

  1. How the contextual data snippets are created and sent to the browser using JSON files
	  - in Developer mode, view the files with long numerical names 
	    requested from read.citeit.net

  2. How to download the sample code from GitHub and upload it to your own server
      - download code from GitHub by selecting green "Code" button
	  - upload the files to your server (or checkout with Git)
	  - how to set permissions for the sample code so index.php has permmissions to 
	    write to folder: "CiteIt.net_json"

  3. How to submit your citations for indexing, to generate new contextual JSON files
  	  - click "New Submission" to go to the Index page
	  - enter the URL of the citing page
	  - JSON files are saved in "CiteIt.net_json" folder
	     - if you don't see the JSON files, check you server's error log to
		   see if the CiteIt.net_json folder permisssions allow writing to www-data

  4. How the CiteIt.net client javascript works.
  	  - View Source: example.html
	  	  Dependencies:
			- jquery, jquery-migrate, jquery-ui
			- forge-sha256, jsVideoUrlParser
		  CSS Depencencies:
		  	- jquery-ui.min.css
			- css/quote-context-style.css
	      Main Depencency:
		    - js/versions/0.4/CiteIt-quote-context.js

			- loop through all blockqoute and q tags:
			   * if tag has a "cite" attribute:
					- construct a hash_key
					- request a json file with a filename constructed from hash_key

					- use JSON file to append data to hidden div: 'citeit_container'
					- append JSON context data to hidden div

  5. How to manually create a new html citation:
     using a YouTube example video with a transcript

	  - Example: Malcolm Gladwell's crime typology: a "Western"

		  YOUTUBE:
		  - view video on YouTube,
		  -	click "..." button to see transcript
	      -	view the text version on CiteIt

		  HTML:
		  - copy this text into the post, add <blockquote cite='url'>
		  - markup is allowed, so long as the markup doesn't alter the text version

		  RE-INDEX PAGE:
		  - YouTube videos take longer to index beause constructing a transcript
		    from the YouTube API is slower than reading html pages


		  FUTURE MEDIA VIEWERS:
		  - In the Future: I would like to create custom media viewers for:
		  	  - vimeo
			  - twitter
			  - soundcloud
			  - generic mp4 video
			  - mp3 audio
			  - ogg
			  - aac
			  - wav
			  - pdf (python code complete.  Docker hosting setup remaining.)
			  - word
			  - powerpoint
			  - image formats
			  - epub
