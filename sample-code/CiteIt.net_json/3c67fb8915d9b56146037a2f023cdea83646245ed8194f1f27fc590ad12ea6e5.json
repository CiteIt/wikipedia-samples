And they'd tell him, the reason we're having you do this is because when you summons people, it's an opportunity to check if they have a warrant. And if they do, you can arrest them, because it means they've committed a serious crime. It made sense to him. EDWIN: You see, at first I felt good because when someone would have a warrant it felt good. It was like, okay he had a warrant. Until one day, it was just, this- the\u2013girl looked like she was 10. And she wasn't my arrest. I arrested someone else with something but she was in the cells. And I said, \"Young girl, like, what are you doing here?\"She's like, \"Oh, like, um, me and my friends, we went through the turnstile together.\" I said, \"Where's your friend?\" \"Oh, my friend, she got a summons and they arrested me.\" I said, \"For what\u2013how old are you?\" \"16.\" I said, \"But for what?

The result was that police officers are given quotas for the number of summons (tickets) they need to issue, forcing them to trump up the charges if necessary. It's a story that illustrates the perils of broken-glass policing and how policing evolved in New York City and other cities: ","citing_quote":"PEDRO: Some guy jumps out.
